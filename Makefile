# Thanks to Tom Szilagyi for his Makefile help.
#
# NOTE: since LADSPA_PATH varies depending on your distro,
# YOU MUST CHANGE THE VARIABLE TO MATCH YOUR LADSPA_PATH
# ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE!
#
# This Makefile also assumes that you already have the ladspa_sdk
# installed and thus have the ladspa.h header file required for
# inclusion in the source files and that it is located in an
# appropriate inclusion path directory.
