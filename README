Revolution is an audio plug-in using LADSPA (Linux Audio Developers Simple
Programming API).  It's simple effect creates a fuzz distortion similar to
that of The Beatles' "Revolution" where, in that case, guitars were plugged
directly into the recording console and intentionally overloaded.

It is written in C with much help from Bart Massey, Tom Szilagyi, David Benson,
Dave Phillips, and Richard Furse--the source file(s) provide the official
thanks and acknowledgements.

This plug-in can be used with any audio program that supports LADSPA plug-ins.
See your favorite audio program's specifications to see if it supports LADSPA
plug-ins.  I used Audacity to test the plugin, but will most likely use Ardour
as my primary audio tool.

This was my first shot at writing a LADSPA plugin, which is why this one is so
simple.  I'm not interested in this effect for usage, because distortion effects
are a dime a dozen.  I only chose this effect to learn the API and get my feet
wet.

I am still a student programmer at the time of this writing, so the comments
in the source code are detailed and directed at the beginner as well.  Hopefully
the comments will be beneficial to those who were like me in learning the API,
and not too annoying for the pro's out there.

To install, make sure the LADSPA_PATH variable in the Makefile is correct to
your environment, and just run (as root) 'make install'.  You can also run
'make uninstall' (again, as root) to remove the plugin.
